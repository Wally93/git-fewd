# Git Fewd ðŸŽ‚

This is a general purpose scratch pad to try out collaborative coding on GitHub. Use this (mostly) empty repo to get comfortable with forking, pulling, commiting, and pushing.

You can also submit pull requests to merge changes back into the main project! Who knows, if it's interesting enough it may even be accepted :)
